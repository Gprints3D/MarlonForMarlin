# MarlonForMarlin
A Marlin firmware configuration wizard (for 3D printers)

Marlon was made in order to make the configuration of Marlin firmware easier to keep up to date.
In the .exe file you will find:

  Automatic setting transfer - Transfers all your old configuration.h and configuration_adv.h automatically without the chance of causing any compilation errors!
  Definition editor - locate, edit and save definitions in your configuration files very easily.
  Firmware Compiler - Uses the PlatformIO IDE Core to compile and save your firmware unto a designated drive or folder.
  
  Feel free to share, and send bug reports via this platform.
